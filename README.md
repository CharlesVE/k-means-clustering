Experiments with k-means clustering

Here I have 3 files. 

1. kmeansclustering_GH.ipynb 
This file runs through a 'manual' use of k-means in order to cluster together data from sklearn for petal length and width.

2. kmeansclustering_sklearn_GH.ipynb
This file does the same as that above however with the help of sklearn.

3. KMeansClusteringPlusPlus_GH.ipynb
